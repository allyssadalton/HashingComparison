**Overview**

The Hashing Comparison project is a C++ study of hash table performance using different collision-handling strategies. The program compares techniques like linear probing, quadratic probing, and chaining by measuring performance under various loads.

**Key Features**

Implements multiple hashing strategies

Loads test data into hash tables and tracks collisions

Measures efficiency using insertion and search performance

Outputs comparative results for analysis

**Skills Demonstrated**

C++ data structures and memory management

Hash table design & collision resolution

Algorithm analysis (time complexity & performance tradeoffs)

Experiment design and benchmarking

Future Improvements

Add more hash functions for comparison

Visualize performance trends with graphs

Extend analysis to large datasets
